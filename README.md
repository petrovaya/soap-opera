# soap-opera

## Conventions and guidelines
* Use camelCase for function and variable definitions and filenames. Use PascalCase for class definitions.

* Class interfaces should be put in .h (header) files and implementaiton should be in .cpp (source) files.

* You shouldn't do any changes to the master branch directly. Always create a pull request.

* You should preferably write in English (not necessary but highly recommended as this is a standard for most companies).
